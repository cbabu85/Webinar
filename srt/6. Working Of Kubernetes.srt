1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,080
Now we've understood what Kuberenets is and how it works.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,280
Let us now go ahead and understand Azure Kubernetes Service.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,230
Now to give you a brief about Azure Kubernetes Service.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,730
As I've already mentioned, it is a Kubernetes Service.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,930
that is hosted on the Azure cloud platform.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,330
OK, so let me just explain that again so that we can go ahead and understand
 
7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,310
how working of Azure Kubernetes happens.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,490
So we've already Seen this slide, what is Azure Kubernetes Service?

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,710
But now that would make a lot more sense for you.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,100
OK.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,120
So what can happen or what Azure Kubernetes service offers to you?

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,430
Do you talk about Azure to start with?

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,890
It is a popular cloud service provider.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,220
What that means is with Azure Kubernetes, or with Microsoft Azure.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,610
You can basically have various services that help you in software development, planning, management,

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,010
right?

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,020
Be it your administrative practices, development practices or architectural practices related to software.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,260
All these things can be hosted on a public server in this case, which again can be on Microsoft Azure

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,560
Cloud.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,530
Now what it does is it basically gives you all these services that are needed to carry out all the actions

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,440
that I just mentioned where you can rent these resources or follow up as you go, model and use these

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,600
services to benefit your requirement.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,140
OK.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,210
Now, when you talk about a platform like Microsoft Azure, which again is a cloud platform, as I've

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,330
just mentioned, the possibility of dealing with applications are plenty.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,630
or the possibilities rather

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,600
are plenty, so you can do so many things.

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,400
So what that does is that gives developers or application owners options to work with these applications

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,450
in numerous ways.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:45,900
Okay.

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,830
It simplifies their complications, right?

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,270
Since you are talking about a platform like Microsoft Azure.

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,870
It helps you basically orchestrate quite a lot of activities be it managing your servers, infrastructure,

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,060
right?

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,610
Be it load balancing, auto scaling.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,790
All these things can be controlled by using the cloud platform.

37
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,400
So what that does is that gives developers the added benefit or the application owners.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,950
This added benefit and that is why what these cloud platforms are doing these days is they are encroaching

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,500
or basically covering different domains?

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,390
Be it your big data or DevOps analytics etc.

41
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,140
All these things are or can be implemented using these platforms.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,600
Because when you talk about this cloud platforms, they are already owning various markets of software

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,190
development and application hosting.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,580
OK.

45
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,630
So that is why having something like Kubernetes work on top of Azure is a benefit way, because some

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,870
of the complications that you would find difficult to implement using Kubernetes, can be controlled

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,790
by using Microsoft Azure.

48
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,970
And that is why you have these added benefits be it your end to end deployment,

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,110
be it your availability or scalability.

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:02,400
If you talk about some of the benefits that it actually offers, what it does is you pay only for the

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,630
node that you use.

52
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,870
That means last time I checked, Microsoft Azure did not charge you for your master node.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,210
You only get charged for your work nodes that you used.

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,400
OK, your cluster upgrades are easier, so you do not have to worry about the patching part and stuff

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,820
like that.

56
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,460
Integration with various azure and other tools and services becomes easier.

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,970
Not just that, what you can also do is you can actually go and enforce various roles that are under

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,020
Azure policy across multiple clusters to have uniformity.

59
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,220
If you need to right? what, you can also do is you can scale Kubernetes and other nodes using autoscaler

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:49,230
that Microsoft Azure support, and you can even expand your scale even greater by scheduling your containers

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,520
on Azure containers.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,500
So that is what Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service provides you with.

63
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,650
Let us now move further in this Azure Kubernetes Service and let's try and understand

65
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,830
some of the other important pointers, like how does the architecture of Azure Kubernetes services

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,220
works?

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,210
OK, to understand the working of AKS, or Azure Kubernetes Service, right?

68
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,340
You can see this diagram on the screen.

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,460
It's a fairly simple diagram and tells you what Azure Kubernetes Service does.

70
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,710
OK, so we've already seen how Azure Kubernetes architecture works Right?.

71
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,370
I mean, we know what all components it has and stuff like that.

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
This is a more detailed view.

73
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,710
So what you'll have is you'll have, again, a Kubernetes.

74
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,240
master master node or cluster is what you can call it.

75
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,580
OK.

76
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,030
So in this master node, the functionality would be same.

77
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,940
It would be controlling how the deployment and how the management of your containers work.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,960
So basically, Azure will manage your master node it will basically help you control quite a few activities

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,750
that are there as a customer, you'd be managing the applications, only that you won't have support from Microsoft

80
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,820
Azure hope you.

81
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:09,400
Understand that now, if you talk about the control plane, what you have here is you have your API server.

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,750
now when you talk about your API server, what it does is it basically tells you how the underlying

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,880
Kubernetes APIs are exposed.

84
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,510
OK.

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,150
What this component basically does is it provides the interaction for your management tools be it your

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,920
Kubectl or the kubernetes dashboard.

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,480
Similarly, you have your etcd.

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,340
Now etcd basically what it does is it maintains the state of your kubernetes when I say the

89
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,120
state of Kubernetes.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm talking about the Kubernetes cluster and basically tells you control all the configuration that

91
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,740
is, there this thing is highly available and it is key value based in nature.

92
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,180
OK.

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,000
But you also have here is basically have a scheduler.

94
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:58,690
What is scheduler does is it lets you create and scale your applications to basically determine which

95
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,600
nodes can run on what workload and stuff like that.

96
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,080
OK.

97
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,920
And finally, you have the controller manager now.

98
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,960
This is an important bit again, what it does is it controls or overseas, a number of smaller controllers,

99
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,270
whether they're performing their actions or not.

100
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,880
And what it also helps you in doing is replicating the pods that you have and handling your nodal

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,990
operations as well.

102
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,330
So this is what your control plane does, and it is basically managed by Azure.

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,910
Now what is the benefit of having a Azure managed right since, Azure, is managing it?

104
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,820
you dont need to worry about the configuration part setting up part, right?

105
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,150
The cluster node is basically set up by Microsoft Azure, and that is what it simplifies.

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,510
Then the other bit is your customer managed bit, be it your Kubelet, your kube-proxy, your container

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,030
and container runtime to understand this better.

108
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,500
I think this diagram should draw a clearer or a better picture for you.

109
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,010
OK.

110
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,840
So basically, when you talk about your customer partner, the quite a few things that you need to know.

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,920
I've mentioned Kubelet, which basically lets you run your Pods.

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Your pods are run by your kubelet.

113
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,250
That is what your Kubelet does.

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,580
OK.

115
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,740
There are other things as well that you need to know here.

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,740
You have your Azure virtual network interface now.

117
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,690
It is something that takes care of all the interface requirements that you might otherwise have.

118
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,090
OK.

119
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,070
And similarly, you have your kube-proxy, right?

120
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:28,330
kube-proxy again works together with your virtual network interface or basically your Azure virtual

121
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,070
network and tells you what needs to be done.

122
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,050
OK, now all these things, they reside on a virtual machine again.

123
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,930
So we've discussed all the differences and benefits.

124
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,230
of it.

125
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,130
So what Azure does is it basically launches a virtual machine for you.

126
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,440
On top of it, your containers would reside.

127
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,690
So when you talk about these containers again, these are nothing but the applications that are running

128
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:49,990
for you.

129
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,410
OK?

130
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,840
And these are the services that would help you actually implement or control all these applications

131
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,090
that are there you can actually go ahead and scale up your virtual machines to meet the requirements

132
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,370
of your application in different ways.

133
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,520
So this is how the working of a AKS is.

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,370
I mean, this is how the Master node works, and this is how your basically custom node or your worker

135
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,690
nodes work when you talk about AKS, will see these as we get into the demo.

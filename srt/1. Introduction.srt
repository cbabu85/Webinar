1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,540
Whenever we talk about container orchestration, we always talk about Kubernetes, which is a very powerful

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,310
container orchestration tool.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,990
Similarly, when we talk about cloud computing, we can always think of Microsoft Azure, which is one

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,780
of the leading cloud service providers in the market.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,070
Now, when we combine these two, we get a service called Azure Kubernetes Service.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,730
Which is a highly popular cloud container orchestration service.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,150
But what is AKS and what does it do in this Azure Kubernetes service tutorial?

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,760
We'll be discussing this topic to the very core.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,750
Now, let us go ahead and take a look at the agenda for the course.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,720
Taking a look at the agenda, we'll be talking about following pointers.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,350
Let's start by understanding what Azure Kubernetes is is .

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,320
But to understand that we would need to get into the details of topics like how software development

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,120
and deployment has evolved over time.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,840
We'd also understand virtual machines and containers.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,340
We'll understand how Kubernetes works to the core.

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,540
Then we'll discuss AKS and understand how it is different from Kubernetes.

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,730
Then we'd go ahead and take a look at a use case that tells us how as a Kubernetes service has helped

18
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,110
customers around the globe.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,970
And finally, we would finish things off with a demo where we would understand how we can actually go

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,660
ahead and spawn container images using Azure Kubernetes service.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,690
So let us not waste any time and quickly get started.

00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,150
So first and foremost, let's try and understand what Asia Kubernetes services.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,840
Now, I'm not going to get into the details of this service right away.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,590
I'll just give you an introduction.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,620
Azure Kubernetes Service is a fully managed container management service.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,860
It is provided by Microsoft Azure, obviously, which is a very popular cloud service provider.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,950
Recent stats also state that it is one of the leading public cloud service providers in the market.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,760
So when you talk about Azure, Kubernetes, it is basically managed by Microsoft Azure.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,450
What it does is it offers serverless, continuous integration and deployment experience.

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,310
Now what does that mean?

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,010
What we can do with it, we'll discuss all those things as we get into the details of Azure Kubernetes

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,730
service.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,800
For now, we need to understand a few other concepts before we get to that point.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,910
But to summarize few of its benefits, what Azure Kubernetes service does is it offers end to end deployment,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
scalability and availability.

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,290
Now how do these things work?
